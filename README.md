# Data Structures and Algorithms

Percolation thresholds via Monte Carlo simulations, 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm, autocomplete for a given set of N strings and positive weights, a k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space, and more.
